# OpenTelemetry Collector Dashboard

This module provisions a Lightstep dashboard for monitoring a OpenTelemetry Collector.

The dashboard can be used to detect data loss, CPU/Memory saturation and details about data ingestion. A HATS (Hourly Active Time Series) graph is also included to monitor the effect of the ingested metrics.

For a more in-depth recommendation on how to monitor and alert on the OpenTelemetry Collector, please refer to [its docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/monitoring.md).
